# Sound-of-Trash
The Sound of Trash examines the sounds and aesthetic qualities of waste, turning discarded materials into creative inspiration. Using animated notation and sound synthesis, the piece encourages listeners to view trash not as useless leftovers but as active elements in an abstract soundscape.

With SuperCollider, the work creates synthetic sounds that imitate the unpredictable and chaotic noises of trash, such as the rustling of paper and the clanging of metal objects.
